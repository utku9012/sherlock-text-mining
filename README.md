# Sherlock Holmes Text Mining & Clustering

This project focuses on text mining using The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The goal is to analyze word frequencies and use K-Means clustering to determine which chapters are more related or unrelated based on their word distributions.

### Steps

##### 1.Fetch Data

##### 2.Text Splitting into 12 Parts 

##### 3.Creating Vectors then Cleaning the Data Using Corpus Library (such as changing every letter to small cap, removing punctuation marks, numbers and most used common words in english to make the model more accurate)

##### 4.Reducing Words to Their Roots and Renaming the Columns

##### 5.Visualization, Histogram and Barplot, Word Cloud, Heatmap

##### 6.Examination with K-Means Cluster Analysis
